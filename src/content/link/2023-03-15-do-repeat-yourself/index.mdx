description: "«Please DRY up your code» is usually bad advice – abstraction creates coupling and complex code. I'd advocate ALRY – ALways Repeat Yourself (once). When that code has matured, you are in a better position to see if it's a matching concept that can be combined to common code – or if it's just accidentally similar."
