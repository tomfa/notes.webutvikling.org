description: "Make it easy to delete: colocate by feature. Make it easy to build it right: automated checks. Make it easy to be newb: reduce knowledge-requirements, embrace dumb questions. Migrate incrementally: large diffs fail. Use a monorepo: reduced error rate. Make code quality derivative positive: make things better over time."
