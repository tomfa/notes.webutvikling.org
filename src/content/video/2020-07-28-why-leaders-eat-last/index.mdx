Extend the circle of safety to the outer parts of the organisation. When employees feels safe and trusted, they can spend they energy being creative and productive.

**Accomplish this by:**

- Spending time and energy with your colleagues. Talk to them instead of emailing them, be helpful and generous.
- Avoid politics inside the organisation.
- Don't steal credit or hand out blame
- Have each others backs
