Let's say we have a tsconfig that specifies `src` folder as input and `dist` folder as output.
What are the differences between `tsc`, `tsc --build` and `tsc --incremental`, which package.json scripts do I use, and how would we cache using `turbo.json`?

### Setup

```json5
// tsconfig.json
{
  // ...
  "include": ["src"],
  "compilerOptions": {
    "outDir": "dist",
    "rootDir": "src"
  }
}
```

```json5
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    // ‚¨áÔ∏è We'll get back to why later
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev:build": "tsc --incremental",
    "dev": "concurrently -n compile,run \"tsc --incremental --watch\" \"nodemon dist/index.js --watch dist\"",
  }
}
```

## tsc
`tsc` will simply look through our `src` folder, and compile output to `dist` folder.
If there exists any typescript errors, it will fail and report it.

Running `tsc` is "safe", but it can get slow to do after a while ‚Äì especially in a larger project.

### --noEmit
[`--noEmit`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#noEmit) will run the same
typechecking, but not output any compiled `js`/`.d.ts` files.

We can use that in a monorepo if we have packages that NextJS transpiles itself.

### -b or --build option
[`-b` or `--build`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) will skip building any files that are "up to date".

There's a huge gotcha with this: "up to date" seems to be based on time stamps
(though it's not found in the documentation, instead see [#46661](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/46661))
on files. This can be unreliable, especially when combined with external tooling
like `turbo`. You may then end up with successful builds even when there exists a
type error in the input file.

### --incremental
[`--incremental`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#incremental) will run like `tsc` the first time, but also create a
`.tsbuildinfo` with hashes of input files.

When running `--incremental` the second time, it'll hash input files and compare
them with the stored version to see if it needs recompiling.
If the file has changed since last build, it will be recompiled.

Unlike `-b` or `--build`, `--incremental` will catch type errors, even if you've built before.

There's a different gotcha here though. It assumes that the `.tsbuildinfo` file is in sync with the `build` folder.
Test this by running `tsc --incremental`, then delete the `dist` folder. It won't reappear after running `tsc --incremental` again.

### --watch
[`--watch`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#watch) will watch our `src` folder for changes, and recompile any files that changes.

It consists of an initial build phase, followed by a watch phase.
The watch phase recompiles any file in `src`, on change. While the initial build can be affected with `--build` or `--incremental`, but it won't affect the watch phase.

### Which should I use?
#### Production (and CI)
When building for production, correctness is more important than speed.
`tsc` without any extra args, avoids assuming that `.tsbuildinfo` is in sync
with the `dist` folder, and not attempting to skip any files.

I'd therefore run `tsc` in production, same for CI.

#### Local build
When building locally, speed being more important than correctness.

I'd therefore run `tsc --incremental` when building locally + add `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo`
to `.gitignore` to prevent it affecting other environments (where code might not yet exists in output folder).

#### Local development
While coding, we'll frequent updates in a single file at a time. We want
to catch type errors as soon as possible, but correctness is not vital.

I'd therefore run `tsc --incremental --watch` in development.

_Note: There's some gotchas here if you end up combining `tsc --incremental`
in some, but not all tasks: `tsconfig.tsbuildinfo` will quickly become invalid._

## tsc + turbo
When we add [turbo](https://turbo.build/) caching to our project, we must specify
which files are considered inputs and outputs. This is done in `turbo.json`.

```json5
// turbo.json
{ "pipeline": {
    // ...
    "build": {
      // Depend on build script in any other packages
      "dependsOn": ["^build"],
      // Not specifying inputs will default to any
      //   file in app folder. One may also want to
      //   optimize this, by only relevant files, e.g.
      //   inputs: [
      //     "src",
      //     "tsconfig.json",
      //     "package.json"
      //   ]
      "outputs": [
        "dist/**",
        ".next/**",
        "!.next/cache/**"
      ]
    },
    "dev:build": {
      "dependsOn": ["^dev:build"],
      "outputs": [
        "dist/**",
        ".next/**",
        "!.next/cache/**",
        "tsconfig.tsbuildinfo"
      ]
    },
    // New script, see updated package below
    "dev:watch": {
      "cache": false
    }
} }
```

We also make an update of our `package.json` scripts:

```json5
// package.json
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "dev:build": "tsc --incremental",
    // This was our old dev command
    "dev:watch": "concurrently -n compile,run \"tsc --incremental --watch\" \"nodemon dist/index.js --watch dist\"",

    // In a mono repo, you can simply move the
    // dev-command below to the root package.json
    //
    // Sidenote: we run dev:build first to prevent
    // nodemon restarts due to incremental build updates
    "dev": "turbo run dev:build && turbo run dev:watch --parallel",
  }
}
```

**üéâ TADA! We're now ready to run `dev` and just program.**

## Conclusion
Caching is hard.

### Sidenote: Why an own dev:build script?
You may ask: _Why not use `dev:build` as the `build` script?_

That's a totally reasonable question! It should work just fine for CI and production too.
A benefit of doing that (in combination with external cache), would be cache hits
on CI due to the commands having been run locally first.

I prefer to have them separate though. By doing that, I can specify different
`dependsOn` jobs for each that optimizes for speed locally and correctness on CI.
In the examples above however, it shouldn't really matter.
