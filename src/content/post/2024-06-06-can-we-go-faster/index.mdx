> "I am worried about the development speed", the manager said.

This post won't be about dev speed. It will be about trust. A lot can be said (and I have opinions there too) about dev speed and how to increase it. I'll keep it short.

## Grunt work speed
Painting a house is grunt work. There's not much thinking, almost just doing.

> Move the ladder. Paint the wall. Move the ladder. Paint the wall. Repeat.

There's some ways of making it go faster<sup>1</sup>
- One coat is enough.
- Use a ladder, don't bother with scaffolding<sup>2</sup> or harness.
- Skip tape, some paint on the windows is fine.
- Don't wait for shade to get a better result, but live with the imperfections that come with painting in sunshine.

<small className={'block'}><sup>1</sup> Not that I necessarily recommend them.</small>
<small className={'block'}><sup>2</sup> Depending on your equipment, skills and height of house, scaffolding may be quicker. But that's besides the point.</small>

## Development speed

Development is not grunt work. It's problem-solving – thinking work. Finding use-cases and empathizing with the user. It's understanding a complex problem or system, and breaking it down in simpler parts.

The speed in development comes from great tools, few features, clear direction, trust and a well rested, motivated head.

And there's some quick ways of making it go faster<sup>1</sup>:
- Sleep well. Tired brain programs backwards.
- Reduce the scope of the task.
- Avoid (most) meetings. If it's important, the information will reach you.
- Don't solve for edge cases. Let users report missing needs instead<sup>2</sup>
- Don't QA edge cases. Let users report bugs instead<sup>2</sup>


<small className={'block'}><sup>1</sup> Not that I always recommend them. There's also a lot I don't cover here: using efficient tools, increasing trust and autonomy of the team, having high degree of automation, being on a greenfield project – but those aren't quick fixes.</small>
<small className={'block'}><sup>2</sup> There's of course a balance to this. It may make you slower in the long run. If the consequences of missing those edge cases causes a lot of work, it may even make you slower short-term.</small>

## Trust

> Saying "I am worried about the development speed", is destructive to speed.

By itself, that's a statement that indirectly saying "I think you're slow" and implies one or more of...

* "I don't trust that you put in the hours"
* "I don't trust you to know your tools"
* "I don't trust you've built a good project setup"
* "I don't trust you know which things matter"

And that's a problem, because trust is the foundation of an autonomous, motivated, high-performing team.
Alone, this statement is likely to erode trust, motivation and mental clarity – at worst even sleep.

## How to constructively talk about speed

It's not wrong to talk about speed. It can be warranted, and it can be quite useful to bring up.

So how can it be done constructively?

### Make sure it's not you

Rather than blurting out "I am worried about _you_", ask yourself first it's maybe about _you_?
Worrying about speed is a typical stress response, and it's easy to project that onto others.

If you don't think that's it, ask someone in the team if they feel the same way. If
you're unable to find a single person on the team that thinks speed is an issue, you may want to reframe the problem. It's very hard to change a team (or person) that doesn't see the problem, even if it's real. Perhaps it's about re-prioritization rather than velocity.

### Give context

Give context to why speed is important _now_.
Is it because of a deadline? Are we running out of cash?

Speed _now_, makes speed slow down _later_, just like an investment (reduced speed) now can increase speed later.
Make sure the team knows that you are aware of that.

### What trade-off should be made?

"Just be faster" is not a real option. The closest thing to "everything, faster, now" is overtime work, but you'll have to pay that back with interests<sup>1</sup>.

Unless that's your situation, you'll have to figure out what trade-off should be made.
What should we have focus on, and what can we let slide?

Maybe there's a quarterly report or money-raising event that makes inbound sales extra important the next 3 months.
A result from that could be to implement some campaigns asap, while postponing that shiny insurance feature.

<small className={'block'}> <sup>1</sup> I believe overtime work might work in a short period, but has to be followed by vacation/reduced work very quickly. Or else, dev brains melt and work halts even more.</small>

### Consider investing in future speed

Is there nothing pressing, no real deadline, no real cash-flow problem, but more
of a nagging feeling that things are slow?

Then consider investing in future speed, by asking the team:
> What can we do in a month to ensure we are faster in 3 months?

Let them ponder this question while working for a week or two, then workshop it out.

  <summary>_Possible velocity improvements_</summary>

  Below are some suggestions of things that, in my experience, can give velocity to developers.

  **Autogenerated API clients**

  Time spent writing out JSON parsing, data validation and re-typing of fields in frontend/backend is such a waste of time. The time spent identifying and fixing bugs related to this is also a soul drain.

  Invest in having autogenerated internal API clients, for instance [TRPC](https://trpc.io/), [GraphQL Code Generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen/), or [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/).

  **End-to-end type safety**

  Similarly to autogenerated API clients, having end-to-end type safety can save a lot of time.
  For instance, [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) can generate types for your database.

  **A good form library**

  Forms are always 10x more complex than I first imagined.

  [React Hook Form](https://react-hook-form.com/) is one of the great ones out there.

  **Component library**

  A component library can save a lot of time, especially if it's well-documented and has a good API.

  I am impressed with the component selection of [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/), and use it with every new project.
  [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) is also a great way to document them with examples. This reduces the time developers wonder "what was the proper way to create an error dialog again". _But_ avoid overengineering the setup.

  **Use Tailwind (and popular libs in general)**

  [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) will take some investment to learn, but it's f-ing awesome.

  - Your knowledge is transferable between projects (and languages!).
  - Great IDE support for e.g. editor preview of the included CSS for class.
  - Emmet support for className makes for faster typing.

  The benefits of selecting a popular tool (like Tailwind) has the benefits of
  being battle-tested, large community/online resources, well-integrated with
  other tools.

  **Learn your editor**

  Knowing your tools is important, but some things require an investment of time that
  not everyone _give themselves time_ to learn at work.

  Here's some tips on getting started:

  - Use [multiple cursors](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_multi-cursor-selection) while solving your next task.
  - Disallow yourself to use the mouse in the editor for 1 week (except for finding shortcuts/changing keyboard setting).
  - [Add 3 snippets for](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_snippets)
  - Set up and solve 1 bug by using the [debugger](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/getstarted/tips-and-tricks#_debugging)

  **Autoformatting and linting**

  Never should a developer:
  - discuss how many spaces should be in a tab
  - doubt on the placement of curly braces
  - consider which quotes to use
  - wonder if they have indented correctly
  - [reorder imports](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-import)

  [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) and [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) can help with that.

  Spend time setting up a good config, with automated fixes on save.
  CI should check that the code is formatted correctly on PRs.

  **Reduce meetings**

  How can we be more aligned and effective, but with less meetings?

  For a company, consider a simple version of OKRs, and letting teams be self-reliant / autonomous.

  For a team, consider a daily standup in Slack (rather than in person) and read a [book](https://basecamp.com/books) on how to decide/spec/design work they way they feel motivate for.
