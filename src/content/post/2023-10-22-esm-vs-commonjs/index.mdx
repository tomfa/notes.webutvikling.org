This is a topic I've been postponing to understand forever. What is what and why should I care as a web-developer.

> What's the syntax difference?

```ts
// commonjs
const { readFile } = require("fs");

// esm
import { readFile } from "fs";
```

> So I guess I use esm today?

Hmm, not so fast. We, like many others, write our code with the `esm` import syntax, but our code is still being transpiled to `commonjs` by `typescript`.
This is a setting in our `tsconfig.json`

> So I don't need to care

Well, maybe you should. If you use `commonjs`, you may have noticed some issues when installing the latest version of `node-fetch`? That's because `node-fetch` is now using `esm` and you're using `commonjs`.

> Why can't I use `commonjs` while `node-fetch` uses `esm`?

Because `commonjs` does not support import of `esm` modules.
`esm` however, does support import of `commonjs` modules.

> So I don't have to care anymore if I use `esm`?

Right, spot on!

> But things work today. Is there any other benefits I gain by changing to `esm`?

- Better interoperability with `node-fetch` and other `esm` modules. This benefit will only increase over time.
- [Top-level await](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html#top-level-await)
- [Better tree-shaking](https://blog.logrocket.com/tree-shaking-and-code-splitting-in-webpack/)

> And downsides?

If you're developing packages for others to consume, you might annoy `commonjs` consumers by publishing an `esm` package. 
`node-fetch` published [this esm/commonjs FAQ](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1279) as a response to all the questions after they transitioned to esm.

I believe a main difference being `esm` modules are imported asyncronously on use, while `commonjs` are imported sync immediately. 
If that's correct, you could argue commonjs to be more suitable serverside?

> Ok, lets go. How do I start using `esm`?

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/node-fetch/node-fetch/issues/1279#issuecomment-915062146)

[In NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/api-reference/next-config-js), rename `next.config.js` to `next.config.mjs`.

> My imports are not working anymore. What's up with that?

You need to add the file extension to your imports. So instead of `import { fish } from "rod"` you need to write `import { fish } from "rod.js"`.

There's a codemod for that, [cjs2esm](https://homer0.github.io/cjs2esm/):

```
npx cjs2esm
```

> __dirname and __filename are not defined anymore. What's up with that?

`__dirname` and `__filename` are not defined in `esm`. You can use `import.meta.url` instead, like in the example below;

```ts
import * as url from 'url';
const __filename = url.fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = url.fileURLToPath(new URL('.', import.meta.url));
```

> Is life better now?

Probably. You should check your apps bundle size before and after to see.
